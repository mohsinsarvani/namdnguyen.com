[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/a7ee7e96-b44a-4a1a-8ef8-9a4d14b0b5e6/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/namdnguyen/deploys)

This is a site built with [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) using [gatsby-starter-lumen](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen).

## Quick Start

#### Create a Gatsby site

Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the Lumen starter.

```sh
# Create a new Gatsby site using the Lumen starter
gatsby new blog https://github.com/namdnguyen/namdnguyen.com
```

#### Start Developing

Navigate into your new site's directory and start it up.

```sh
cd blog
yarn develop
```

#### Open the source code and start editing!

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).

Open the `blog` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/templates/index-template.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## Deploy with Netlify

[Netlify](https://netlify.com) CMS can run in any frontend web environment, but the quickest way to try it out is by running it on a pre-configured starter site with Netlify. Use the button below to build and deploy your own copy of the repository:

<a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/namdnguyen/namdnguyen.com" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy to Netlify"></a>

After clicking that button, you'll authenticate with GitHub and choose a repository name. Netlify will then automatically create a repository in your GitHub account with a copy of the files from the template. Next, it will build and deploy the new site on Netlify, bringing you to the site dashboard when the build is complete. Next, you'll need to set up Netlify's Identity service to authorize users to log in to the CMS.

## Access Locally
```
$ git clone https://github.com/[GITHUB_USERNAME]/[REPO_NAME].git
$ cd [REPO_NAME]
$ yarn
$ yarn develop
```
To test the CMS locally, you'll need run a production build of the site:
```
$ yarn build
$ gatsby serve
```
